Peacock are breathtaking birds, and their ornate feathers are truly one of a kind. Learn more about what makes Peacock unique below.

Colorful Characters – As if peacocks didn’t already sport brightly colored raiment, humans have selectively bred a number of different color mutations. Through breeding, we now have white, piebald, cream, and other colors.
A Peacock’s Tail – Peacock obviously have amazingly long and beautiful tails. However, the peacock’s tail, called a train, actually grows from its back. They are part of the tail, but actually the feathers that cover the true tail.
Most Mature Males – It takes a while to grow such an impressive train, and peacocks require some aging before they can strut their stuff. Their tails do not begin to grow until they are two years old, and males do not have fully developed tails until they reach the age of four.
Feral Peacock – When humans first began to keep and breed these birds, everyone wanted one. All the richest and most influential people just had to have a peacock to display on their lawns. However, this created a problem when the birds escaped and began breeding in various cities across the world.
